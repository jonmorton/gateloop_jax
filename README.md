Attempted replication of GateLoop Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01927) in JAX.

I believe this is the most faithful reproduction of gateloop's time mixer to date. Information on architecture details was obtained from discussion [here](https://github.com/lucidrains/gateloop-transformer/discussions/1) and [here](https://gist.github.com/mgostIH/0d4a5b614f1b9829f7471d888133d99b)
